---------------Under  Wait Events Statistics  ------------------
This section shows a breakdown of the main wait events in the database including foreground and background database wait events 
++++From Wait event statistics, focus on "Foreground Wait Class",  "Foreground Wait Events"  ,  "Background Wait Events"   -- %DB Time

      Time Model Statistics
      Operating System Statistics
      Operating System Statistics - Detail
      Foreground Wait Class    -- DB CPU, Network	, Cluster, User I/O, Application, Concurrency, Configuration, Administrative	and others.
      Foreground Wait Events   -- TCP Socket (KGAS), enq: UL - contention, gc buffer busy release, enq: TX - index contention, etc like that ( which is assiciated with User process ) 
      Background Wait Events   -- This section is relevant to the background process wait events.
                               log file parallel write, db file parallel write, latch: MGA heap latch, PGA memory operation ( which is associated with Oracle background process ) 
      Wait Event Histogram
      Wait Event Histogram (up to 64 us)
      Wait Event Histogram (up to 32 ms)
      Wait Event Histogram (up to 2 sec)
      Wait Event Histogram (up to 2 min)
      Wait Event Histogram (up to 1 hr)
      Service Statistics
      Service Wait Class Stats
      Top 10 Channel Waits
      Top Process Types by Wait Class
      Top Process Types by CPU Used

--------------------Under SQL Statistics -----------------------

++++ Mostly will focus on " 

        SQL ordered by Elapsed Time   ---will look for  "% Total DB Time" and then executions, if executions are less but "%Total DB Time" is high, then we have to drill down further.
        SQL ordered by CPU Time       -- Will look for "%Total"  and then executions 
        SQL ordered by User I/O Wait Time
        SQL ordered by Gets
        SQL ordered by Reads
        SQL ordered by Physical Reads (UnOptimized)
        SQL ordered by Offload Eligible Bytes
        SQL ordered by Executions
        SQL ordered by Parse Calls
        SQL ordered by Sharable Memory
        SQL ordered by Version Count
        SQL ordered by Cluster Wait Time
        Complete List of SQL Text


--------------  IO Stats   ------------- No need to focus 
        
        IOStat by Function summary
        IOStat by Filetype summary
        IOStat by Function/Filetype summary
        Tablespace IO Stats
        File IO Stats

------------ Buffer Pool Statistics  -----------------No need to focus 
      Buffer Pool Statistics
      Checkpoint Activity


----------- Advisory Statistics  ----------------- will look for statitics based on performance 
      Instance Recovery Stats
      MTTR Advisory
      Buffer Pool Advisory
      PGA Aggr Summary
      PGA Aggr Target Stats
      PGA Aggr Target Histogram
      PGA Memory Advisory
      Shared Pool Advisory
      SGA Target Advisory
      Streams Pool Advisory
      Java Pool Advisory


--------  Wait Statistics   -----------------No need to focus 
      Buffer Wait Statistics
      Enqueue Activity

--------- Undo Statistics-----------------No need to focus 
      Undo Segment Summary
      Undo Segment Stats

--------  Latch Statistics-----------------No need to focus 
      Latch Activity
      Latch Sleep Breakdown
      Latch Miss Sources
      Mutex Sleep Summary
      Parent Latch Statistics
      Child Latch Statistics

--------  Segment Statistics   - Sometimes we may, but not all the times 
      Segments by Logical Reads
      Segments by Physical Reads
      Segments by Physical Read Requests
      Segments by UnOptimized Reads
      Segments by Optimized Reads
      Segments by Direct Physical Reads
      Segments by Physical Writes
      Segments by Physical Write Requests
      Segments by Direct Physical Writes
      Segments by Table Scans
      Segments by DB Blocks Changes
      Segments by Row Lock Waits
      Segments by ITL Waits
      Segments by Buffer Busy Waits
      Segments by Global Cache Buffer Busy
      Segments by CR Blocks Received
      Segments by Current Blocks Received
      Segments by Global Cache Remote Grants

----- Rest we mostly ignore them -------------

----- Active Session History (ASH) Report ----- we will always look at this section 

      Top SQL with Top Events
      Top SQL with Top Row Sources
      Top Sessions
      Top Blocking Sessions
      Top PL/SQL Procedures
      Top Events
      Top Event P1/P2/P3 Values
      Top DB Objects
      Activity Over Time
