wait events under User I/O
--------------------------

These events are related to I/O operations that occur when accessing user data. Here are some common User I/O wait events:
	
	
	1. db file sequential read:
	
	This event occurs when a session reads a single block from a data file sequentially (e.g., during index scans or table scans).
	Itâ€™s often associated with SELECT statements.
	
	2. db file scattered read:
	
	Similar to sequential read, but it involves reading multiple non-contiguous blocks from a data file.
	Commonly seen during full table scans.
	
	3. direct path read:
	
	Used for parallel query operations.
	Sessions read data directly into PGA (Program Global Area) memory without using the buffer cache.
	
	4. direct path write:
	
	Similar to direct path read, but for write operations.
	Used during parallel DML (Data Manipulation Language) operations.
	
	5. log file sync:
	
	Occurs during commit operations.
	The session waits for the redo log buffer to be flushed to disk.
	
	6. log file parallel write:
	
	Writes redo log entries to disk in parallel.
	Associated with high commit rates.
