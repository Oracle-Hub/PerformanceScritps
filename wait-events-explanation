wait events under User I/O
--------------------------

These events are related to I/O operations that occur when accessing user data. Here are some common User I/O wait events:
	
	
	1. db file sequential read:
	
	This event occurs when a session reads a single block from a data file sequentially (e.g., during index scans or table scans).
	It’s often associated with SELECT statements.
	
	2. db file scattered read:
	
	Similar to sequential read, but it involves reading multiple non-contiguous blocks from a data file.
	Commonly seen during full table scans.
	
	3. direct path read:
	
	Used for parallel query operations.
	Sessions read data directly into PGA (Program Global Area) memory without using the buffer cache.
	
	4. direct path write:
	
	Similar to direct path read, but for write operations.
	Used during parallel DML (Data Manipulation Language) operations.
	
	5. log file sync:
	
	Occurs during commit operations.
	The session waits for the redo log buffer to be flushed to disk.
	
	6. log file parallel write:
	
	Writes redo log entries to disk in parallel.
	Associated with high commit rates.


System I/O wait events in Oracle. These events are related to background process I/O. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here are some common System I/O wait events:

1. db file parallel write:

This event occurs when the Database Writer (DBWR) process writes data blocks to disk in parallel.
It’s associated with buffer cache flushing.

2. log file parallel write:

Similar to the previous event, but specifically for writing redo log entries to disk in parallel.
High commit rates can trigger this wait event.

3. log file sync:
Occurs during commit operations.
The session waits for the redo log buffer to be flushed to disk.
Ensures data durability.

4. control file parallel write:

Involves writing to the control files (used for database metadata).
Associated with administrative tasks or configuration changes.

5. direct path read/write:

Used for parallel query operations.
Sessions read or write data directly into PGA memory without using the buffer cache.
